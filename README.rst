Python API for Hisense Televisions
##################################

|Build Status| |Black| |PyPi Version| |docs|

A work-in-progress python API for Hisense televisions based off of `mqtt-hisensetv`_.

Installation
************

Linux
=====
.. code:: bash

    sudo -H python3.8 -m pip install hisensetv

Windows
=======
.. code:: bash

    py -3.8 -m pip install hisensetv

CLI Usage
*********
::

    usage: hisensetv [-h] [--authorize] [--get {sources,volume}]
                     [--key {back,down,exit,left,menu,power,right,up}] [--no-ssl] [-v]
                     hostname

    Hisense TV control.

    positional arguments:
      hostname              Hostname or IP for the TV.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --authorize           Authorize this API to access the TV.
      --get {sources,volume}
                            Gets a value from the TV.
      --key {back,down,exit,left,menu,power,right,up}
                            Sends a keypress to the TV.
      --no-ssl              Do not connect with SSL (required for some models).
      -v, --verbose         Logging verbosity.

One Time Setup
==============
**Note:** This is not required for all models!

::

    hisensetv 10.0.0.128 --authorize   
    Please enter the 4-digit code: 7815

Keypresses
==========
::

    hisensetv 10.0.0.28 --key up
    [2020-02-29 13:48:52,064] [INFO    ] sending keypress: up

Gets
====
::

    hisensetv 10.0.0.28 --get volume
    [2020-02-29 13:49:00,800] [INFO    ] volume: {
        "volume_type": 0,
        "volume_value": 1
    }


No SSL
======
Some models do not have self-signed certificates and will fail to connect
without ``--no-ssl``.

Please open an issue if yours is not listed here!

Limitations
***********

Concurrency
===========
* Multiple instances of this class will conflict with one-another.
* Not thread-safe.
* This API really *should* be asyncio in 2020, but asyncio is not yet part of the paho mqtt library (see `455`_).

Reliability
===========
* The concurrency issues contribute to reliability issues in general.
* Unit tests do not exist yet.

Security
========
* The self-signed certificates from the TV are completely bypassed.
